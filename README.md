# Hostel Room using OpenGL (C++)

We have rendered a hostel corridor having 8 identical furnished rooms in OpenGL.
The rooms have basic furniture like Beds, Tables, Almirahs, Doors, Windows, Ceiling Fan etc.

The objects are Interactive. On a button press, we can open and close the doors and windows, rotate the fan, etc.
Camera movement is also implemented.

The coordinates of these objects are hard-coded. 
The room also features lightning effect with 2 lights in each room.
Libraries used are GLEW and FreeGlut.
